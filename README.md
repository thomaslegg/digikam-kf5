This is a FreeBSD ports skeleton for digikam-kf5. It's designed to be built against the plasma5 branch of the area51 repository.

This ports incorporates the digikam-docs and digikam-l10n ports as options. It also updates the other options and brings in a new option for multimedia playback from digikam. This has been tested and works with qt5.6.x-multimedia.
